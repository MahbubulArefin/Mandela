                <h2> <b>The Man Who Sought Freedom</b> </h2>
                <p><b>Mandela</b> was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South
                    Africa's Cape
                    Province.
                    [2] Given the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker",[5] in later
                    years he becameknown by his clan name, Madiba.[6] His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka,
                    was ruler of the
                    Thembu Kingdom
                    in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.[7] One of
                    Ngubengcuka's sons,
                    named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname.[8] Because Mandela was the
                    king's child
                    by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of
                    the royal
                    family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal
                    councillors.[9]</p>
